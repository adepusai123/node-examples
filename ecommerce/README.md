Creating a Microservices architecture for an **e-commerce MVP** with Node.js, MongoDB, Express.js, Docker, 
and Kubernetes involves serveral steps. 

**Architecture Overview**
We'll create two services for simplicity, but this architecture can be easily expanded:

1. **Product Service** - Handles Product related operations
2. **Order Service** - Handles order-related operations

Each Service will:
- Have its own MongoDB database.
- Communicate with other serivces using **HTTP REST or gRPC** (We use REST here)
- implement security checks, validation and modular code
- Be deployed using Docker for containerization
- Have deployment scripts and pipeline for **CI/CD** (With **Kubernates and Docker**)
